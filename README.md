# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version
  ruby -v
  Make sure Rails is installed

  rails -v
  If you see Ruby and Rails version then you are good to start, other wise Setup Ruby On Rails on Ubuntu

  Once done, Now

Clone respected git repository

https://github.com/mmtoure/api_auth_rails.git
Install all dependencies

bundle install
Create db and migrate schema

rake db:create
rake db:migrate
Now run your application

rails s

p.s If you are not using RVM yet I would strongly recommend doing so!
